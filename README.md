# Mindboxed-Web
As the title indicates, the MindBoxed is a tile-based game with allows players to create levels. The basic mechanism is picking pre-designed tiles and implementing that to the actual level completely made up by the user.
What makes it different is the community system, the reward system from the community and _ "Best of the Day" _ such social features. The purpose of the project is to let kids learn the basic method for designing and let them feel a sense of achievement by receiving external recognition.
Also, each level designed by others only takes "one shot". If the player failed on the first try, then he cannot play this level anymore. This allows players to think before they actually get down to the project and not be too addicted to the game.
